# Wireless-Communication-Networks Service Provider Planning Tool

This MATLAB project is designed to facilitate the planning process for a service provider owning 340 channels in the 900 MHz band. The tool prompts the user for various parameters including Grade of Service (GOS), city area, user density, SIRmin, and sectorization method. It then computes and provides essential design parameters for the system using the Hata model for outdoor propagation.
